# TankTurnScript
The tank turn script seeded by steve and updated by vesper! Feel free to make a PR to update!

Installation instructions:
1) Install The Tampermonkey browser extension or a similar extension to your browser.
2) Copy and paste the js script as a script in your extension.
2a) NOTE: You may have to enable developer mode for your browser to allow for script injection. Be careful when running random scripts if you don't know what they do.
3) Go to a map, go to your extension settings for tamper monkey, and toggle on the script. If it works, a "map analyzer" should show up!
